### ❤️ About the Project

The **Heart Disease Analysis** project focuses on understanding the key factors influencing heart disease through **interactive visual analytics**. Using **Tableau**, the project combines health-related data such as age, gender, lifestyle habits, clinical indicators, and comorbid conditions like diabetes and stroke.

The project transforms complex healthcare datasets into **intuitive dashboards and story-based visualizations**, enabling users to quickly identify patterns, assess risk factors, and derive actionable insights. This data-driven approach supports **early detection, informed decision-making, and increased health awareness**.
